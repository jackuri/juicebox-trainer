## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-06

### Added
- Monorepo skeleton: Rust workspace (`ot-core`, `ot-packs`, `ot-saves`, `ot-mcp`, `testbed-native`,
  desktop shell) and npm workspace for `apps/desktop`.
- Tauri 2 desktop app (React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind 4, Vite) that boots and shows its version via an
  `app_info` command.
- `testbed/native`: a fake console game with health, ammo, gold and speed behind a heap pointer chain
  (static root → World → Player → Stats), a JSON stdin/stdout side channel for tests, x86 builds, and a
  `shifted` feature that changes offsets.
- CI on `windows-latest`: rustfmt, clippy (`-D warnings`, plus x86 testbed), cargo tests, ESLint,
  TypeScript typecheck, Vitest.
- `scripts/check.ps1` (runs every CI check locally) and `scripts/bump-version.mjs` (bumps all manifests).
- MIT licence, README, STATUS.
